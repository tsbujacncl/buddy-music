## üéØ **MVP Philosophy: Free Music First**

**Core Strategy:** Build an excellent free music platform FIRST, add payments LATER.

**Why this approach:**
* ‚úÖ Simpler MVP - fewer moving parts to debug
* ‚úÖ Faster to launch - no TrueLayer integration complexity
* ‚úÖ Prove value - validate that people WANT to use Buddy
* ‚úÖ Build audience - grow listener/artist base before monetization
* ‚úÖ Lower risk - test product-market fit without payment headaches

**MVP Focus:**
* **Free music streaming** - Global, no login required
* **Artist uploads** - Global, all tracks free initially
* **Discovery** - Search, browse, playlists
* **Clean UX** - Prove Buddy is better than SoundCloud for free music

**Payments (v1.1 - Later):**
* Add TrueLayer after MVP validation
* Enable UK/EU artists to set prices
* Enable UK/EU listeners to purchase

## üö® **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

1. **Don't overthink M0-M7** - Keep it simple, launch fast
2. **Don't optimize prematurely** - Get it working first
3. **Don't build payments before M10** - Validate free music experience first (M0-M8)
4. **Don't skip M7 testing** - Test on real devices, not just emulator
5. **Don't hardcode secrets** - Use environment variables for API keys
6. **Don't skip milestones** - Each builds on the previous one
